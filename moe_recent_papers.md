**1. MoEUT: Mixture-of-Experts Universal Transformers (Csordás et al., 2024)**

*   **Implementation Structure:**
    *   **Universal Transformer (UT) based:** Inherits the UT's characteristic of depth-wise recurrence via shared parameters across layers, providing inductive biases for better compositional generalization.
    *   **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers:** Introduces sparsity by replacing standard Transformer layers with MoE layers for both feedforward (using σ-MoE) and attention (using SwitchHead) components.
    *   **Layer Grouping:** Stacks multiple layers with non-shared weights to form groups, which are then recurrently stacked. This reduces the number of experts needed and increases the total number of attention heads without a proportionate increase in computational cost.
    *   **Peri-layernorm Scheme:** Applies layer normalization only before linear layers that precede sigmoid or softmax activations. This is designed to address issues with residual norm growth in UTs.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Improved Parameter-Compute Ratio:** MoEUTs achieve parameter efficiency through layer sharing, while MoE layers help manage computational cost.
    *   **Strong Compositional Generalization:** Inherits UT's ability to decompose structured problems and generalize to longer sequences.
    *   **Competitive Language Modeling:** Outperforms standard Transformers on language modeling tasks like BLiMP and PIQA, using less compute and memory.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **First UT to slightly outperform standard Transformers** on language modelling tasks.
    *   **Superior parameter-compute ratio:** More efficient use of parameters for a given level of computation.
    *   **Strong performance on tasks requiring compositional generalization.**
    *   **Reduced memory footprint and computational cost** compared to dense models of similar performance.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Slower training:** Currently 1.5-2x slower than standard Transformers due to suboptimal MoE layer implementation in Triton.
    *   **Limited scaling experiments:** Experiments were conducted up to 1B parameters, leaving massive scaling potential relatively unexplored.
*   **Task Suitability:**
    *   **Language modeling:** Demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks.
    *   **Tasks requiring compositional generalization:** Shows promise due to the UT foundation and layer-sharing mechanism.
    *   **Code generation:** Outperforms the baseline on The Stack dataset.

**2. Nexus: Specialization meets Adaptability for Efficiently Training Mixture of Experts (Gritsch et al., 2024)**

*   **Implementation Structure:**
    *   **Sparse Upcycling:** Initializes MoE from separately trained dense expert models, a technique known as "upcycling."
    *   **Adaptive Routing with Domain Embeddings:** The core innovation is the router. It uses a learnable projection layer that maps domain embeddings to expert embeddings. Routing decisions are based on the similarity between the input's representation and these expert embeddings.
    *   **Shared Expert:** Employs a shared expert (similar to other MoE works) that is always activated, removing parameter redundancy.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Efficient Adaptation to New Domains:** New experts can be added post-upcycling by simply computing their domain embedding and appending it to the router.
    *   **Enhanced Specialization:** Routing based on domain embeddings promotes expert specialization.
    *   **Improved Performance on Upcycled MoEs:** Outperforms previous upcycling methods on downstream tasks.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Fast adaptation:** Enables quick extension of MoE models with new experts without large-scale retraining.
    *   **Maintains specialization:** Adaptive routing mechanism preserves the specialization learned during the dense expert pre-training.
    *   **Robust to load balancing and data mixtures.**
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Reliance on pre-computed domain embeddings:** Requires a suitable method for generating domain embeddings.
    *   **Potential for catastrophic forgetting:** Extending the model with new experts might lead to forgetting of previously learned knowledge, although experiments show minimal drop in general performance.
*   **Task Suitability:**
    *   **Tasks requiring adaptation to new domains or data distributions:** The adaptive routing makes it well-suited for scenarios with evolving data.
    *   **Multi-task learning:** Can potentially handle a diverse set of tasks by adding specialized experts.
    *   **Transfer learning:** Pre-trained dense experts on specific tasks can be leveraged.

**3. BAM! Just Like That: Simple and Efficient Parameter Upcycling for Mixture of Experts (Zhang et al., 2024)**

*   **Implementation Structure:**
    *   **Sparse Upcycling with Attention Experts:** Similar to BTX, it initializes MoE layers from pre-trained dense models. However, it goes beyond FFN layers and also upcycles attention layers into a "soft" Mixture of Attention (MoA) variant.
    *   **Soft-MoA:** Unlike traditional MoA with top-k routing, BAM's MoA uses soft routing, assigning each token to every attention expert with varying weights.
    *   **Parallel Attention Transformer:** Employs a parallel attention architecture to allow concurrent computation of attention and FFN experts.
    *   **Two Variants:**
        *   **BAM with KV Experts:** All attention parameters (Q, K, V) are treated as experts.
        *   **BAM with KV Sharing:** Key and value parameters are shared across all attention experts, improving inference efficiency.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Full Utilization of Dense Model Parameters:** Upcycles both FFN and attention parameters, capturing more knowledge from the dense models.
    *   **Improved Training Stability:** Soft routing in MoA contributes to more stable training dynamics.
    *   **Enhanced Performance:** Outperforms BTX in terms of perplexity and downstream task performance.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Better use of pre-trained models:** Leverages both FFN and attention expertise.
    *   **Parallel computation:** Parallel attention architecture improves throughput.
    *   **Strong empirical results:** Demonstrates consistent gains over BTX and other baselines.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Increased computation due to soft routing:** Although mitigated by parallel attention, soft routing still increases computation compared to top-k routing.
    *   **Memory overhead:** Maintaining individual KV caches for each attention expert (in the KV Experts variant) can increase memory usage during inference.
*   **Task Suitability:**
    *   **General language modeling:** Shows strong performance across various domains.
    *   **Tasks where attention mechanisms play a crucial role:** Upcycling attention experts is particularly beneficial.
    *   **Code generation**: Demonstrates capabilities in code-related tasks.

    *   **Scalable architecture:** Efficiently scales the number of experts without a linear increase in total parameters.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Computational overhead:** While efficient, the expert decomposition and routing mechanisms still add computational cost compared to dense models.
    *   **Complexity:** Implementing and training such a large-scale MoE model can be complex.
    *   **Potential for overfitting:** The large number of experts might increase the risk of overfitting to the training data.
*   **Task Suitability:**
    *   **Tasks requiring fine-grained control over model behavior:** Knowledge manipulation capabilities make it suitable for tasks where specific knowledge needs to be added, removed, or modified.
    *   **Interpretability research:** The focus on monosemanticity makes it a valuable tool for studying the internal representations of LLMs.
